## I don't see a license file. Is it open source? Can U fork it?

Unfortunately, I am not in a position to open source it, mainly because it uses css from https://frontendor.com. Since I am not clear under what license their code is released, I don't want to run the risk of permissively licensing my own code.

## Can I get a demo?

Of course! Just TO or CC bookmarks@moogle.cc on any email, then click on the shortlink. It'll take you to the webpage version of your email.
